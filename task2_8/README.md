Create an online store with a shopping cart.
Create pages according to the Figma designs. Should be implemented Desktop and mobile layouts.

FYI
1) Create and import JSON file with needed data structure for the list of elements;
2) Filtering and Searching functionality should be exist (as on Figma design);
3) Implement Adding to the Cart (elements should have a functionality of adding to the cart).

IMPORTANT: data which was added to the cart should store in local storage. (After reloading the items which was added to the cart should be exist)
